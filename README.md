# BorwellSoftwareChallenge
This was what I made for an opportunity at Borwell. I had to make a software which could calculate the area of a room, the volume and how much paint is needed to cover the walls.

# Running the Software
To run this software, you will atleast need Python installed on your machine. Then it is as simple as running the file.
